title: "Why I think my brain is like an autocorrect. Like a large language model."

That fine day 3 years ago, I looked at my phone, the autocorrect keyboard, and realised how clunky it was, just like my essay writing skills.
Clunky = slow and lacking in foresight.

Let's break communication down into 2 ideas - idea structure, and language. It parallels the basic framework of macro versus micro.
What idea structure is related to are things like a story circle, rise and fall narrative, how many supporting arguments, are you wedging counter-arguments into a paragraph of premises - how many and where?, how long is your segue?
And what language is related to are things like breadth of conjunctions, do you use "therefore" or replace it with a clause such as "But it didn't matter, because". 

Perhaps I had only myself to blame for consuming media for 4 years on 1.5x speed. I had consumed and understood the arguments for and against a social issue. And true enough, I could reproduce them verbally. But it means it was too fast to absorb the language, and I was lacking an arsenal of phrases that people would use to express and link ideas; I could only express ideas in single word chains.  
So that's for language. When you watch a advertisement for a sponsor on a youtube video, language is the thing that allows you to express it in a more corporate manner. An apologetic manner. A filmed on my crappy phone authentic manner. 
In my autocorrect brain, words instead of phrases popped up on screen above the keyboard, and that was all I could type. "Flowery and bombastic language" meant using "flowery" and "bombastic", not poetic phrases.

But the thing that made me feel like writing was like autocorrect to my brain was in structure.
For the longest time, I could only write essays in premise-conclusion form. I had counter arguments, but 1) I didn't know if they were relevant, or 2) where to present them. Verbally, I would have just spat it all out and made the listener make sense of it. 
Repeatedly, I was told to "elaborate" on my points. But I had already written the premise and the conclusion? What is elaboration? Is that including how 3 separate research institutes have calculated the cost to produce a red mug? I had already explained everything between premise and conclusion. Was it more premises?
i tried making a youtube video essay and it was the worst possible experience. How do you start each paragraph? How do you even start the video? What are the points going to be about? Are you going to take a detour, and when? 
I find it impossible to create this structure before even putting pen to paper, or keyboard to screen. But I know what I think about the issue.

And so I write essays on the scale of a word-by-word autocorrect.
The-color-of-the-tomato-has-attracted-people-for-centuries.
I can actually feel my brain thinking of the next sentence as I complete one. THe conclusion stares in my face, and I am so lost, so, so lost.

Recently, I've started to pay attention to how video essays are written. I should do it before the incentive to learn to do so disappears.
